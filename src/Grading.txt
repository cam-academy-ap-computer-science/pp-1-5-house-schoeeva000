Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but anything
that shows the structure of your program is helpful.

Your program is well structured, and I liked your use of
print statements to improve efficiency even further.  Well
done.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call malt(), you call jb() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add jb() at the end of your malt() method, and
remove it other places.  Then, you could do the same thing
with rat() (add malt() at the end of it), etc.  Your cow() function,
then, would be all you needed to print most of the last verse.
